Restore the old school icons in WPBakery Page Builder, as used before Version 8.0.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin adds a module to [WPBakery Page Builder plugin](https://wpbakery.com), bringing back the old school style of editor elements icons that WPBakery used in versions prior to 8.0.

If, like me, you fall in love with interfaces you've used for decades, then this plugin can be useful for you if you don’t feel comfortable with the new 'Add Element' popup icons in WPBakery Page Builder introduced after version 8.0.
After installing the plugin, you can enjoy the old icon style again in both the backend and frontend WPBakery Page Builder editors. You can always switch it on or off in the Module interface on the WPBakery Page Builder settings page.

Source file code you can find on [our GitHub plugin page](https://github.com/OlegApanovich/add-wpbakery-old-school-elements-icons-module)

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress admin dashboard.

== Screenshots ==
